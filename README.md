Introduction
In this project, we use machine learning techniques to classify music genres based on audio features. We employ a variety of libraries, including OpenCV, TensorFlow, pandas, and librosa, to process audio data, extract features, and train a classification model.

Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd music-genre-classification
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow librosa
Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the music genre classification model.

Visualize audio data, spectrograms, and other relevant features using matplotlib and librosa.

Tune the model's hyperparameters and architecture for optimal results.

Project Structure
